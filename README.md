The overall design of the project was an evolving experience. I did not have a
specific goal, but instead tried things out and let the design evolve. This made
the overall design hard to keep straight, until I looked at some basic templates 
for websites and picked a couple that I used as inspiration. I still added things 
as I learned about them and wanted to experiement with new ideas.

Things become much easier when I adapted the bootstrap framework to help organize
the website into rows and columns. This allowed me to stop worring about the exact 
position of elements and making sure they lined up. I spent way to much time doing 
that.

The other difficult part was trying to get the right colors and spacings for elements.
Again, it became easier when I used bootstrap, but there were still little alignment
issues that occured. I think it would go much smoother if I had someone else with
a design background telling me what they wanted and I wrote the code for them. That
way the color scheme and placement would not have to be done by me.

Adding javascript to the website was easy and a fun process. I wish I had more time to
learn javascript. One of my goals was to have the mouse hover on the pictures of my
family and then a description of them emerge. While I found some code to make that
happen, I was not able to implement it for a variety of reasons. This would be one of
my first goals if I continue working on the project. 

Overall, I'm happy with how the website turned out. I tried to keep the content and 
design to a sleek design and think it worked to an extent. I found it really hard
to not have the website look like something from the 90's and went through several
different color schemes. Something that I found interesting is that less is more for
color and keeping it simple often works best.
