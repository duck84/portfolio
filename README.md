The overall design of the project was an evolving experience. I did not have a
specific goal, but instead tried things out and let the design evolve. This made
the overall design hard to keep straight, until I looked at some basic templates 
for websites and picked a couple that I used as inspiration. I still added things 
as I learned about them and wanted to experiement with new ideas.

I initial had problems with positioning boxes on the screen correctly. This is 
something I have struggled with in all of the assignments and one of the parts
of html and css that I find the most difficult. I do not think in terms of 
placement, positioning and pixel size. I spent a lot of time trying to get objects
to line up, only to realize that it was only going to work on that particular screen
I was using. When I would switch to the schools computer everything looked different.

Things become much easier when I adapted the bootstrap framework to help organize
the website into rows and columns. This allowed me to stop worring about the exact 
position of elements and making sure they lined up. I spent way to much time doing 
that. It was also nice to have built in resizing and structure. I no longer need to
worry about how things lined up as much and could focus more on the fun parts of 
designing my websited. Bootstrap defintly made the process go faster.

The other difficult part was trying to get the right colors and spacings for elements
with in the rows and colums to align correctly. Again, it became easier when I used 
bootstrap, but there were still little alignment issues that occured. I think it 
would go much smoother if I had someone else with a design background telling me 
what they wanted and I wrote the code for them. That way the color scheme and 
placement would not have to be done by me.

Adding javascript to the website was easy and a fun process. I wish I had more time to
learn javascript so I could really take advantage of it. One of my goals was to have
the mouse hover on the pictures of my family and then a description of them emerge. 
While I found some code to make that happen, I was not able to implement it for a 
variety of reasons. This would be one of my first goals if I continue working on the
project. 

Overall, I'm happy with how the website turned out. I tried to keep the content and 
design to a sleek design and think it worked to an extent. I found it really hard
to not have the website look like something from the 90's and went through several
different color schemes. Something that I found interesting is that less is more for
color and keeping it simple often works best.
