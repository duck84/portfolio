The overall design of the project was an evolving experience. I did not have a
specific goal, but instead tried things out and let the design evolve. This made
the overall design hard to keep straight, until I looked at some basic templates 
for websites and picked a couple that I used as inspiration. I still added things 
as I learned about them and wanted to experiement with new ideas.

Things become much easier when I adapted the bootstrap framework to help organize
the website into rows and columns. This allowed me to stop worring about the exact 
position of elements and making sure they lined up. I spent way to much time doing 
that.
